# AdvancedDataGridViewDataModel
Sample project to demonstrate Advanced DataGridView that filters using a C# model object instead of a DataTable.

This allows you to bind your DataGridView to a List of objects instead of a DataTable.

The code is rough around the edges but as a proof of concept works.. Potential improvements could be to automatically detect the type of the column being filtered to determin the correct Linq query syntax.

Tested with datatypes: int, string, bool, DateTime double & decimal.
